## Getting to know the data

At first glance, and by inspecting the data structure we can see the follow:

```{r}
str(dataset)
```

Our data has `r nrow(dataset)` observations and `r ncol(dataset)` variables; some of those variables are related to the assessment of several developmental domains in infants (age range: `r paste0(range(dataset$edad_cronologica_meses), collapse = " - ")` months old) using the *Ages & Stages Questionnaire, 3th Edition* (ASQ-3), which is a developmental screening tool that pinpoints developmental progress in children between the ages of one month to 5.5 years.

For every subject we have at least one measurement and in average `r dataset[,.N, paciente_id][, round(mean(N), 2)]` assessments.

```{r}
