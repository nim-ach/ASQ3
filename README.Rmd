The purpose of the {ASQ3} package is to provide access to the data collected by the Centro Asistencial Docente e Investigaci√≥n de la Universidad de Magallanes (CADI-UMAG). 

The data were treated, eliminating any sensitive information that could compromise the identity of the participants or linked individuals.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ASQ3 from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nim-ach/ASQ3")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the dataset from your <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> console.

```{r example}
library(ASQ3) # Load the package

head(dataset[, 1:4], n = 5) # Print the first 5 rows of the first 4 columns
```
